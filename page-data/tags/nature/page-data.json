When I told people that I was going to or had been in the Dolomites they had no idea what they were, the truth is that I didn’t even know it until, a couple of years ago, my mother mentioned that she would like to visit them. In short, the Dolomites is a mountain range that is part of the Alps. It is located in northern Italy in the provinces of Belluno, Bolzano, Trento, Udine and Pordenone. Although it has many mountains that exceed 3000 m. the highest is the Marmolada with 3,342 m. Finally add that they were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2009. {{< fancybox path=”https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/” file=“FrtS9KPeZX30OEmnliUkxSyjzXiDpAIAY9JrEaeXwdvEQiKUry7xrf2qWy17dlKdRa1GpvQ4GBW1GEdOZO99pDehohJs5gPXJpzCiCopRAx3-HQwsk7azrXk-KbJzWjDsy-QwsM2NyJxaJnCeFfoE4nqz15qpKwDU9M0Sd9CjRf5V8-t2xaAuu1ChLIHK18T9EdamM3UygxoPdlV-9nnw6CDl-NPDEyrOB157N1kJsdYwxeHPRT62bO9JQxIyWhuEdxYDnlDw0vtx683oBGZMu4ImdNE6-kCKrfeXDAVN1worm4EdoPPMnwoWlAV1EFTnfPT6wW8WLwH4dwUPaSZVU1dc6HmThve7J-7YoKDu6WKKyS3N3TDgPIWjqbk9pfDXoQGRfAbJdzubxASetpTcnh86VNHfcRMiFw152mmg2pcdVRzmyBs2o-7bFExXJd2fPSBTrX7yhlzknW5vgVaBY7SOR6SLnans6GwEpdmIDQ3V39-ef48whTutWGABJf3CiuZj7JT2P7QC7-MIM_cRAIF6edh9TPxMcfOE5bnV-LR22tzcsqcgkEKyibzCUMkZQcC7fwAdzfaWdSc3NiCp8PGKfOZbWDrcWUTMl6MyedJLB2YDr2PyJenHTEyArrgiZAgxV38NcGFX1Mpo1NHTb9xIczS0Qfu2zxoUludsYzgpIuDU=w959-h720-no” caption=“Dolomites map” gallery=“Dolomites Gallery” >}} See the map in depth Table of Contents Our Route First day: Trento Second day: Lago di Carezza Third day: Cortina d’Ampezzo Fourth day: Bolzano and Lago di Garda Conclusion Our Route First day: Trento We left Alicante about 11:00 in the morning and arrive in Milan (Malpensa Airport) about 13:00. Upon arrival we picked up the car that we had previously rented to move during the trip. Although most of the towns and cities are well connected by train and bus, we decided to rent a car for having the option to visit places where the buses did not arrive and for the freedom that it entails. We rented the car at Autoeurope, a website that I had previously used and that had given me good results. Basically it is a price comparison and car rental companies in which after selecting the days and the point of collection and return shows you a table with the different car models, prices and valuations of each company. In our case we rent a Golf for 5 days for about 120 euros. Once with the car we headed towards Trento on the highway.
