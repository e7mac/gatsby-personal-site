This is a story about my team's hard work developing not a single ecommerce platform, but a reusable one for different owners, keeping the same codebase, look and feel, but being highly customizable. I will conclude with what we learned from it which I believe can be a useful learning resource for other software developers out there and to ourselves in future projects.

I will try to focus on the relevant parts as much as possible to make it easier to understand. Having said this, a bit of domain is needed to go through this lecture.
