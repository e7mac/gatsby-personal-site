The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. Here I will share the knowledge and experiences from my time living there for anyone planning to visit the Islands. This guide will provide a general view of them and then focus on the ones I visited.

This guide is based on my own experience therefore some aspects and opinions are not as objective as others.

Here is the map from my [World Places project](https://ramonmorcillo.com/map) where I added some of my favorite places from them and others that people suggested to me. To use it, have a look at the legend and select the layers you are interested in.

Although I did not visit every island, a good reason to go back in the future, I can confirm a well-known fact about them: _they are all very different._ Each one has different landscapes, cultures, and gastronomy.

This fact is perfect because no matter what your travel style is, you will find one that suits your needs.

Most of the pictures and data from this guide come from my time living there however other external resources properly credited have been used too.

## Nature

Being an Atlantic archipelago of volcanic origin, the nature of the Canary Islands offers original landscapes. A subtropical climate is found among them that varies depending on the altitude.

There is great biological diversity from humid forests to arid deserts and high mountain areas.

Sometimes _Calima_ situations occur. Calima (haze) is the local term used to describe the presence of suspended dust that comes from the African continent (mainly from the Sahara and Sahel deserts).

The flora is very different compared to the mainland one. From all the new variety of plants you can find here, there is one that stands out and only lives here: The **Canary Islands dragon tree** or **Drago**.

There is another tree that can be found in other parts of the world, however, the variety of the Canary Islands is unique. The **Canary Pine** is the most abundant tree in the Canary Archipelago from where it is endemic. It can reach heights greater than 60 m and the most shocking: Is resistant to fire! This is due to the thickness of the bark which is why it survives moderate fires.

The Canary Islands are known around the globe to be [a perfect stargazing spot.](https://ramonmorcillo.com/basic-tips-for-amateur-star-photography/) The quality and low light pollution of its skies are such that they have multiple Observatories. La Palma and Tenerife have two international astronomical observatories of the International Astronomical Center dedicated to the _study of how the universe in which we live works._

## History

The first Indigenous peoples of the Canary Islands were the **Guanches**. They supposedly arrived from North African and are related to the _Berbers. _However, I heard other theories that relate them to other ancient civilizations like the Vikings, Phoenicians, or Romans.

![Guanches sculptures in Tenerife and Fuerteventura.](./assets/guanches_sculptures_in_tenerife_and_fuerteventura.jpg)

In the 14th century, Europe began to rediscover the islands. And in the **15th the Conquest of the Canary Islands by Spain** started with Lanzarote and Fuerteventura and ended with Tenerife in 1495. **In 1492 Columbus' fleet sailed from La Gomera, towards the New World.**

**Until the 18th century,** Immigrants from Europe came to the Canary Islands, and from the Canary Islands, emigrants also left America.

Other nations tried to seize the Canary Islands from Spain. The most famous that could have changed the fate of the archipelago occurred in 1797. The British Vice-Admiral Nelson along with 4000 soldiers were defeated trying to conquer Santa Cruz de Tenerife defended by barely 500 Spaniards, a French detachment, and local militias.

**In the 20th century,** the Spanish civil war, postwar, and the dictatorship of General Franco brought times of misery and emigration, mainly to Venezuela.

Since the 1960s, **mass tourism** has burst into the islands as a new economic alternative, which lasts until today.

After the approval of the Spanish Constitution in 1982, the process of formation of the State of the Autonomies began. **Nowadays the Canary Islands is one of Spain’s 19 autonomous communities.**

Its **flag** colors represent the two provinces separated by the sea. The white color of the _Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife_ and the yellow color of the _Province of Las Palmas._

## Gastronomy

Every island has its own distinctive food. However, there are some meals that you will be able to find in all of them. Seafood is very common too, the sea is close after all.


### Papas arrugadas

Probably the most well-known meal from the islands. They are small baked potatoes that are frequently accompanied by _mojos_. They are called **arrugadas** which means they have wrinkles on the skin.

### Mojos

The main sauces from the Canary Islands. The _red mojo_ and the _green mojo_. The red is also known as "mojo picón". Although the red one is the best known outside the archipelago, both are equally important among the islands.

![Chocos (little sepias) served with green mojo and papas arrugadas in Tasca Restaurante Los Pinos, Garachico, Tenerife.](./assets/chocos_little_sepias_served_with_green_mojo_and_papas_arrugadas_in_tasca_restaurante_los_pinos_garachico_tenerife.jpg)

The red one is normally spicier and is made with peppers. It is commonly served with meats while the green one is used for fish and is made with green pepper, parsley, and garlic.

### Goat food

Goats are the dominant farm animal on the islands therefore a lot of meals are made with resources coming from them. The smoked cheese with mojos and or palm honey was my favorite starter there.

### Gofio

If there is a distinctive food from the Canary islands it has to be the Gofio.

> Gofio is a sort of Canarian flour made from roasted grains (typically wheat or certain varieties of maize) or other starchy plants - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gofio)

Canary people use it in plenty of dishes: soups, stews, desserts, etc. If you are in La Palma,  it is worth visiting the Gofio Interpretation Museum (MIGO)  to learn in-depth about this food.

![Gofio sprinkled over cod and mojos in Bodegón San Vicente, Tenerife.](./assets/gofio_sprinkled_over_cod_and_mojos_in_bodegon_san_vicente_tenerife.jpg)

### Desserts

To end the meal there is nothing better than a “Quesillo” or “Polvito Uruguayo”. The first one is a mix between cheesecake and flan. 

![Quesillo from Restaurante Playa Casa Africa near Benijo, Tenerife.](./assets/quesillo_from_restaurante_playa_casa_africa_near_benijo_tenerife.jpg)

The Polvito Uruguayo on the other hand is made of cream, caramel, and cookies.

### Venezuelan food

The Canary Islands have historically been influenced by Venezuela and a great part of its population comes from there. Therefore, plenty of its cuisine and restaurants are Venezuelan. Be careful because it’s easy to fall in love with their “Tequeños” and “Cachapas”.

Fish and seafood are also quite common and of good quality.

### Others

Here are common food products among the Canary Islands very rare around other world places. The most distinctive are the crisps **Munchitos,** the soda **Clipper,** and the candy bars **Ambrosias.**
