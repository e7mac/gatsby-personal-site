The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. Here I will share the knowledge and experiences from my time living there for anyone planning to visit the Islands. This guide will provide a general view of them and then focus on the ones I visited.

This guide is based on my own experience therefore some aspects and opinions are not as objective as others.

Here is the map from my [World Places project](https://ramonmorcillo.com/map) where I added some of my favorite places from them and others that people suggested to me. To use it, have a look at the legend and select the layers you are interested in.

Although I did not visit every island, a good reason to go back in the future, I can confirm a well-known fact about them: _they are all very different._ Each one has different landscapes, cultures, and gastronomy.

This fact is perfect because no matter what your travel style is, you will find one that suits your needs.

Most of the pictures and data from this guide come from my time living there however other external resources properly credited have been used too.

## Nature

Being an Atlantic archipelago of volcanic origin, the nature of the Canary Islands offers original landscapes. A subtropical climate is found among them that varies depending on the altitude.

There is great biological diversity from humid forests to arid deserts and high mountain areas.

Sometimes _Calima_ situations occur. Calima (haze) is the local term used to describe the presence of suspended dust that comes from the African continent (mainly from the Sahara and Sahel deserts).

The flora is very different compared to the mainland one. From all the new variety of plants you can find here, there is one that stands out and only lives here: The **Canary Islands dragon tree** or **Drago**.

There is another tree that can be found in other parts of the world, however, the variety of the Canary Islands is unique. The **Canary Pine** is the most abundant tree in the Canary Archipelago from where it is endemic. It can reach heights greater than 60 m and the most shocking: Is resistant to fire! This is due to the thickness of the bark which is why it survives moderate fires.

The Canary Islands are known around the globe to be [a perfect stargazing spot.](https://ramonmorcillo.com/basic-tips-for-amateur-star-photography/) The quality and low light pollution of its skies are such that they have multiple Observatories. La Palma and Tenerife have two international astronomical observatories of the International Astronomical Center dedicated to the _study of how the universe in which we live works._

## History

The first Indigenous peoples of the Canary Islands were the **Guanches**. They supposedly arrived from North African and are related to the _Berbers. _However, I heard other theories that relate them to other ancient civilizations like the Vikings, Phoenicians, or Romans.

In the 14th century, Europe began to rediscover the islands. And in the **15th the Conquest of the Canary Islands by Spain** started with Lanzarote and Fuerteventura and ended with Tenerife in 1495. **In 1492 Columbus' fleet sailed from La Gomera, towards the New World.**

**Until the 18th century,** Immigrants from Europe came to the Canary Islands, and from the Canary Islands, emigrants also left America.

Other nations tried to seize the Canary Islands from Spain. The most famous that could have changed the fate of the archipelago occurred in 1797. The British Vice-Admiral Nelson along with 4000 soldiers were defeated trying to conquer Santa Cruz de Tenerife defended by barely 500 Spaniards, a French detachment, and local militias.

**In the 20th century,** the Spanish civil war, postwar, and the dictatorship of General Franco brought times of misery and emigration, mainly to Venezuela.

Since the 1960s, **mass tourism** has burst into the islands as a new economic alternative, which lasts until today.

After the approval of the Spanish Constitution in 1982, the process of formation of the State of the Autonomies began. **Nowadays the Canary Islands is one of Spain’s 19 autonomous communities.**

Its **flag** colors represent the two provinces separated by the sea. The white color of the _Province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife_ and the yellow color of the _Province of Las Palmas._
