The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. Here I will share the knowledge and experiences from my time living there for anyone planning to visit the Islands. This guide will provide a general view of them and then focus on the ones I visited.

This guide is based on my own experience therefore some aspects and opinions are not as objective as others.

Here is the map from my [World Places project](https://ramonmorcillo.com/map) where I added some of my favorite places from them and others that people suggested to me. To use it, have a look at the legend and select the layers you are interested in.

Although I did not visit every island, a good reason to go back in the future, I can confirm a well-known fact about them: _they are all very different._ Each one has different landscapes, cultures, and gastronomy.

This fact is perfect because no matter what your travel style is, you will find one that suits your needs.

Most of the pictures and data from this guide come from my time living there however other external resources properly credited have been used too.

## Nature

Being an Atlantic archipelago of volcanic origin, the nature of the Canary Islands offers original landscapes. A subtropical climate is found among them that varies depending on the altitude.

There is great biological diversity from humid forests to arid deserts and high mountain areas.

Sometimes _Calima_ situations occur. Calima (haze) is the local term used to describe the presence of suspended dust that comes from the African continent (mainly from the Sahara and Sahel deserts).

The flora is very different compared to the mainland one. From all the new variety of plants you can find here, there is one that stands out and only lives here: The **Canary Islands dragon tree** or **Drago**.

There is another tree that can be found in other parts of the world, however, the variety of the Canary Islands is unique. The **Canary Pine** is the most abundant tree in the Canary Archipelago from where it is endemic. It can reach heights greater than 60 m and the most shocking: Is resistant to fire! This is due to the thickness of the bark which is why it survives moderate fires.

The Canary Islands are known around the globe to be [a perfect stargazing spot.](https://ramonmorcillo.com/basic-tips-for-amateur-star-photography/) The quality and low light pollution of its skies are such that they have multiple Observatories. La Palma and Tenerife have two international astronomical observatories of the International Astronomical Center dedicated to the _study of how the universe in which we live works._
