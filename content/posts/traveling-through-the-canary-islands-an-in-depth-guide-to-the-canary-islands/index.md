The Canary Islands are a Spanish archipelago located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco. Here I will share the knowledge and experiences from my time living there for anyone planning to visit the Islands. This guide will provide a general view of them and then focus on the ones I visited.

This guide is based on my own experience therefore some aspects and opinions are not as objective as others.

Here is the map from my [World Places project](https://ramonmorcillo.com/map) where I added some of my favorite places from them and others that people suggested to me. To use it, have a look at the legend and select the layers you are interested in.

Although I did not visit every island, a good reason to go back in the future, I can confirm a well-known fact about them: _they are all very different._ Each one has different landscapes, cultures, and gastronomy.

This fact is perfect because no matter what your travel style is, you will find one that suits your needs.

Most of the pictures and data from this guide come from my time living there however other external resources properly credited have been used too.
