Just as there is the **Physical First Aid** technique that we all have seen or heard about, there is also a _psychological_ one not so well known. It could be said that it is just **as important as the first one.** As a way to introduce this topic and without going deeper into it a simple comparison could be that _unlike Physical First Aid, in the psychological one, you don't wait for an ambulance to arrive._

For this reading, I structured the content in a basic _problem-solving_ way based on the principle of the [Five Ws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)

## What is Psychological First Aid

**Psychological First Aid is a technique used with people who have just suffered the impact of tragic news, an accident, or have experienced a catastrophe.** People who are in shock and feel vulnerable. They are trying to understand what has happened to them and the consequences of it.
