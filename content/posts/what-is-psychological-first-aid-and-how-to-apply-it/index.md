Just as there is the **Physical First Aid** technique that we all have seen or heard about, there is also a _psychological_ one not so well known. It could be said that it is just **as important as the first one.** As a way to introduce this topic and without going deeper into it a simple comparison could be that _unlike Physical First Aid, in the psychological one, you don't wait for an ambulance to arrive._

For this reading, I structured the content in a basic _problem-solving_ way based on the principle of the [Five Ws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Ws)

## What is Psychological First Aid

![The New Universe  81, 1964, Klaus Bürgle.](./the_new_universe_81_1964_klaus_burgle.jpg)

**Psychological First Aid is a technique used with people who have just suffered the impact of tragic news, an accident, or have experienced a catastrophe.** People who are in shock and feel vulnerable. They are trying to understand what has happened to them and the consequences of it.

## When to apply it

It is indicated to apply it **from immediately after the impact of what has happened until approximately 72 hours later.** 

This does not mean that after 72 hours the affected do not need help, just that psychological first aid is the proper technique in the first 72 hours after the event.

After a month after the incident, if the person has not recovered from his normal life, it is advisable to go to a doctor.
