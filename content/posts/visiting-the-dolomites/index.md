When I told people that I was going to spend some days visiting the Dolomites they had no idea what they were, and, the truth is that neither did I until, a couple of years ago, my mother mentioned that she would like to visit them.

In short, the Dolomites is a mountain range that is part of [the Alps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alps). It is located in **northern Italy** in the provinces of Belluno, Bolzano, Trento, Udine, and Pordenone. Although it has many mountains that exceed 3000 m. the highest is the **Marmolada** with **3,342 m**. **They were declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2009**.

## First day: Trento

We left Alicante about 11:00 in the morning and arrive in Milan (Malpensa Airport) at about 13:00. Upon arrival, we picked up a car we had previously rented because although most of the region is well-connected by train and bus, we wanted to **visit places freely and at our pace**.

We rented the car at Autoeurope, a website that I had previously used on a trip to Croatia, and I had a great experience with it. There you can compare and choose from a variety of car rental companies. We (4 people) ended up renting a Golf for 5 days for 120 euros more or less.

We then headed towards Trento on the highway. In Italy the speed limits are:

* **130 km/h** on the highways.
* **110 km/h** on the main roads.
* **90 km/h** on secondary roads
* **50 km/h** in urban areas.

When we arrived at Trento we drove to the hotel which was about 10 minutes by car from the center, on the side of a mountain.

After leaving our luggage, we went down to Trento and parked in one of the **many public car parks** (free after 8) to have a look at the city.

Despite the city was not very big it was full of life and had many charming squares, especially the main one, the _Piazza Duomo_.

## Second day: Lago di Carezza

On the second day, we had our last walk at Trento in the morning and bought some local Italian products at the _[Mercato Giornaliero](https://goo.gl/maps/mN917WdRzk1FuETP9)_. We mainly got cheeses and sausages from the area such as the _Speck_ and some fruits.

> The speck is a ham with a distinctive juniper flavor originating in the historical region of Tyrol, which is cured with salt and smoked.

Our next objective was the _[Lago di Carezza](https://goo.gl/maps/ZiktEE5wbXXhT9Cf8)_. The fastest way to get there was heading up to Bolzano and then turn right. We planned to visit Bolzano the last day, so we took a slightly longer route passing through _Pozza di Fassa_.

The lake was beautiful, **the blue-green hues of the water** is what most caught my attention. If you have any idea of approaching the shore, you should know that the lake is **fenced around a perimeter**. Which, although it does not allow you to get too close or bathe, prevents people from littering or destroying the area around it.

We end up going along a **trail that surrounds it** along which you can see the lake from different points of view and not very long to travel (half an hour).

Later we arrived in **Canazei** where we stayed in an apartment the rest of the nights. Canazei is a large municipality located in the northern part of the ***Val di Fassa***. It is also a place for snow tourism and base station for excursions and climbs to *Sella*, *Marmolada* and *Sassolungo*.

## Third day: Cortina d'Ampezzo

On the third day we decided to go to **Cortina d'Ampezzo** not only for seeing the city itself, but for the **route through the Dolomites with spectacular views**. In order to see the maximum we went and returned by different paths.

On the way we took the route that passes through ***Passo Pordoi*** and on the way back we took the route through ***Passo di Giau***. Both routes lasted about 1 hour and 30 minutes each.

If you decide to rent a car to enjoy the views you will be reassured to know that **the vast majority of roads in the Dolomites are well paved and fit two cars** although they are not delimited by a continuous line in the middle.

Cortina d'Ampezzo is larger than Canazei and is a winter sports complex known for its ski slopes, landscapes, accommodations, shops. It is very frequented by the international jet-set.

![Cortina d'Ampezzo main street](./20190829_dolomites-2019_cortina-dampezzo_001.jpg)

On the way back we passed by *Fedaia Lake* from where we could see the **Marmolada Glacier**.

## Fourth day: Bolzano and Lago di Garda

The last day we got up early and went early to **Bolzano** a city west of Canazei and north of Trento. It is a **bilingual city** where **both Italian and German are spoken**. The most remarkable street was ***Via dei Portici***, one of the main streets where shops were located on the sides under porticos.

![Bolzano. Via dei Portici](./20190830_dolomites-2019_bolzano-via-dei-portici_001.jpg)

After Bolzano and on the way to Milan Airport, we stop in a couple of villages on the shores of ***Lago di Garda***, **the largest lake in Italy**. First we were in ***Riva del Garda*** and later ***Peschiera del Garda***.

![View of Lake Garda from Riva di Garda](./20190830_dolomites-2019_riva-di-garda_001.jpg)

Both *Riva del Garda* and *Peschiera del Garda* are cities whose *main activity is Tourism*. In Peschiera del Garda was more remarkable than in Riva given the large number of restaurants and shops of tourists on the shore of the lake.

## Conclusion
After having been in other cities and more popular areas of the country years ago this trip has discovered me **an Italy very different from what I was used to** that did not expect at all. The Dolomites is an incredible area that if you have the opportunity to go you should not miss it, but **if you can afford to rent a car to tour it do not hesitate** because otherwise you will probably miss part of the landscapes described above.
