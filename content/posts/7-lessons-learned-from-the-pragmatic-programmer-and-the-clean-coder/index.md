I recently finished reading both books: _The Pragmatic Programmer 20th Anniversary Edition_ (2019) and _The Clean Coder_ (2011) which are found on almost every “top 10 Software Development books” lists out there. My goal was to learn, improve, and get something a teacher from mine used to say: “_knowledge that can’t be obtained from just reading articles_.”

When you are developing software you may get stuck at a point where Youtube videos and Stackoverflow answers don’t help. You end up reaching for the official docs, or the source code of that technology to find the answer. The same thing happens when you want to understand the subject properly. **Articles fall short and reading well-known books is the best approach.**

These books focus not only on how to write code but on teaching you best practices for developing software and even useful life lessons. I’ll share some lessons I learned from them.

## Taking Responsibility

As a software developer, you are responsible for the code you create and must ensure that it not only works now but will do in the best possible way for a long time (nothing lasts forever). The best way to make sure the code won’t fail is by testing it, having automated tests that you run each time you write new lines to be sure everything is still working.

> Take Responsibility. Responsibility is something you actively agree to.
> — The Pragmatic Programmer

Responsibility is not only related to coding, you have to **take responsibility for improving yourself** too and get better by scheduling time for it. 

> Professionals spend time caring for their profession. Presumably, you became a software developer because you are passionate about software and your desire to be a professional is motivated by that passion.
> — The Clean Coder

> Your knowledge and experience are your most important day-to-day professional assets.
> — The Pragmatic Programmer
