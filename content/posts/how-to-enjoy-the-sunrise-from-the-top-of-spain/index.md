Last month some friends and I made it to the **Teide’s summit (3.718 m) at night** to enjoy the sunrise from it. The experience was probably one of the best I have had in life and after being asked multiple times how we did it (route, clothes, timings, ...) I decided to explain it here for anyone interested in doing it. By the way, I added a [TLDR version at the end of the article](fewfewfew) in case you don’t want to read all of it.

We were a five people group, a good number to stay close enough during the hike and not spread out. Remember this is not a normal hike given the fact of doing it at night so, even if you are in good shape **it can be tough for casual hikers.**
