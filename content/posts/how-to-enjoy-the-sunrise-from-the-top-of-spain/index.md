Last month some friends and I made it to the **Teide’s summit (3.718 m) at night** to enjoy the sunrise from it. The experience was probably one of the best I have had in life and after being asked multiple times how we did it (route, clothes, timings, ...) I decided to explain it here for anyone interested in doing it. By the way, I added a [TLDR version at the end of the article](#TLDR) in case you don’t want to read all of it.

We were a five people group, a good number to stay close enough during the hike and not spread out. Remember this is not a normal hike given the fact of doing it at night so, even if you are in good shape **it can be tough for casual hikers.**

## Basic information

Some things you must know about the adventure:

- As said in the title, the Teide is the **biggest mountain in Spain** with a high of **3718 meters.**
- About the hike, the distance is around **8 km** with a very steep slope including **gradients of up to 60%** and takes about **5.5 hours** on average. The start point altitude is 2348 m so, the **elevation gain is 1370 m.**
- In case you are thinking of doing it by daytime, you’ll need **permission to hike it from 9 am until 6 pm.** You automatically get permission to hike up the tip If you plan to stay on the refuge.
- There is a **cable car,** but it **does not run on windy days.** Take it into account because you may end up hiking it down too.
