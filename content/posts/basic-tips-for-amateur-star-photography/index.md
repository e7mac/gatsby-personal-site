Some time ago I was living in the Canary Islands, a set of islands well-known for having one of the clearest skies in the world. Amazed by the stars’ views my housemates and me spent some nights stargazing.

Those were not my first nights contemplating the stars on a clear sky, but the fact of **capturing them contributed more to enjoy the moment.** I always thought this kind of activity was just for professional photographers but **after understanding some concepts even someone with no experience can enjoy it and take awesome pictures.**

I will share what I learned so anyone can experience it too. Be advised that I am no professional photographer and that I will explain technical concepts in a _simpler_ way as this article is addressed to beginners.
